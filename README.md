# RCG-Neuro: Neural Plasticity Framework for LLMs

RCG-Neuro implements the Rejection-Collapse Governance (RCG) framework, enabling adaptive neuroplasticity in Large Language Models during inference. Based on theoretical work in discrete spacetime physics and universal optimization principles.

## 🧠 Core Concept

RCG-Neuro treats neural pathways like a physical network under stress:
- Incoherent computations create "stress" in specific pathways
- Stress accumulates until reaching collapse thresholds
- Conservative weight transfers occur during collapse events
- Total weight magnitude is preserved (conservation law)

## 🔬 Key Features

### Incoherence Detection
- H_entropy: Token prediction uncertainty
- H_repetition: N-gram loop detection
- H_attention: Attention weight entropy
- H_dynamism: MLP activation variance

### Performance Optimizations
- 99% memory reduction via sparse tracing
- Index-based targeting for precise intervention
- Efficient 4-bit weight modification during inference
- No double forward passes

### Conservation-Aware Weight Modification
- Live modification of 4-bit quantized weights
- Conservative weight transfers between pathways
- Strict preservation of total weight magnitude
- Anatomically-aware stress application

## 📊 Technical Details

### Memory Efficiency
- Stores only top 5% problematic MLP neuron indices
- Captures top 25% problematic attention head indices
- Kilobytes instead of megabytes per trace
- Real-time memory usage monitoring

### Weight Modification Process
1. Dequantize target weight matrices
2. Perform conservative weight transfers
3. Requantize with strict conservation
4. Reset local stress fields
